  <h1>System Overview</h1>

  <p>The FCM system is designed to simplify the task of managing and building
  source code. It consists of the following components:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Code Management</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>FCM uses <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> for
      version control. For a summary of its main features please refer to the
      <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with
      Subversion</a> book. Subversion is a generalised tool which can be used
      in lots of different ways. This makes some day-to-day tasks more complex
      than they need be. FCM defines a simplified process and appropriate
      naming conventions. It then adds a layer on top of Subversion to provide
      a natural interface which is specifically tailored to this process. Where
      appropriate it simply makes use of the command line tools provided by
      Subversion. However, in other cases it provides significant additional
      functionality, e.g.:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>By making some assumptions about the repository layout (i.e. by
        imposing a standard working practice) FCM simplifies the task of
        creating branches and enforces a standard branch naming
        convention.</li>

        <li>Having defined working practices and standard log messages allows
        FCM to greatly simplify the process of merging changes between
        branches.</li>

        <li>FCM makes use of <a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a> (a
        graphical diff and merge tool) to allow users to easily examine changes
        they have made and to simplify the process of resolving any conflicts
        which result from a merge.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>FCM uses <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, a powerful web
      based tool, to manage software projects. <a href=
      "http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> has the following features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A flexible issue tracker which can be used to keep track of bugs,
        feature requests, etc. Each issue (known as a <q title=
        "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">ticket</q> within Trac) can
        be given a priority and assigned to a particular person. Changes made
        to your Subversion repository can easily be traced to the relevant
        ticket. Where appropriate, tickets can be used to record information
        about who has reviewed each change.</li>

        <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap">roadmap</q>
        feature which helps you to plan and manage project releases. Each
        ticket can be associated with a particular milestone. Trac can then
        easily show you what features or fixes went into a particular release
        or what work remains before a particular milestone is reached.</li>

        <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki">wiki</q> which
        can be used for project documentation.</li>

        <li>A browser for viewing your Subversion repository which allows you
        to browse the project tree / files and examine revision logs and
        changesets.</li>

        <li>A timeline view which summarises all the activity on a project
        (changes to the tickets, wiki pages or the Subversion repository).</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Build and Extract</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>FCM features a powerful build system, mainly aimed at building modern
      Fortran software applications. It has the following features:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Parallel build.</li>

        <li>Efficient incremental build. Changes to the MD5 checksums of source
        files and/or the build configuration (e.g. changes to the compiler
        flags) trigger the appropriate re-compilation.</li>

        <li>Inheritance of items from an existing build.</li>

        <li>Build dependency analysis.</li>

        <li>Automatic generation of include files to contain the calling
        interfaces of standalone functions and subroutinues in Fortran source
        files.</li>

        <li>Extract of source files from multiple repositories and working
        copies.</li>

        <li>Extract and merge of source files from different branches of
        development.</li>

        <li>Minimal configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The diagram below illustrates how these components fit together.</p>
