=over 4

=item --config-file-path=PATH, -F PATH

Specify paths for searching configuration files specified in relative paths.

=item --config-file=PATH, --file=PATH, -f PATH

Specify paths to the configuration files. (default = fcm-make.cfg in the
current working directory)

=item --directory=PATH, -C PATH

Specify the path to the destination. (default = $PWD or whatever is specified
in the "dest" setting in the configuration file)

=item --ignore-lock

Ignore lock file. When the system is invoked, it sets up a lock file in the
destination.  The lock is normally removed when the system completes the make.
While the lock file is in place, another make invoked in the same destination
will fail. This option can be used to bypass this check.

=item --jobs=N, -j N

Specify the number of (child) processes that can be run simultaneously.

=item --new

Remove items in the destination created by the previous make, and starts a new
make.

=item --quiet, -q

Decrease the verbosity level.

=item --verbose, -v

Increase the verbosity level.
